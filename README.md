Colorless to IRC daemon
=======================

This is a proof of concept that you can make such a daemon in about half an hour or less. It
connects to the Colorless chat server, the main channel, and to the \#Colorless channel on
the Rizon IRC server, and mirrors the messages from the Colorless to there.
